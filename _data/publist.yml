  image: c3.gif
  description: we report a novel rare-earth-free self-activated blue phosphor Ca2Sb2O7, synthesized by solid-state reaction method. The electronic structure and bandgap of the material were determined by the density functional theory (DFT + U) method using Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional. The prepared phosphor could be effectively excited in the range 280–370 nm resulting in a broad blue emission band, owing to the Sb5+ → O2− transition in the (SbO6)7- group.

  description: LSPR based multisensory design is theoretically proposed for simultaneous detection of multiple analytes. Tuneable sensor performance across a broad sensing range 0.4 to1.8 RIU with maximum sensitivity of 4267.60 nmRIU−1, FOM 82.23 RIU−1 and Q factor 116.51 respectively is observed. The proposed device with an RI sensing range of 0.4 to 1.8 RIU finds applications as a multipurpose and/or multi-channel-based analyte analyser.

  description: Selected-ion recording (SIR) or multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) protocols are widely employed for the quantification of targeted analytes by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Using p-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) as a model compound, we demonstrate that the nature of the LC mobile phase exerts a significant effect on the chromatographic peak intensities.
