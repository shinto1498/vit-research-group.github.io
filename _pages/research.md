# Research

Our overarching goal is to explore and understand new quantum states of electronic matter on the atomic scale. To do so, we use and develop novel spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM) tools to visualize the relevant quantum mechanical degrees of freedom.

Our goal is to build instruments and develop techniques that enable us to address the questions we find most interesting. This is possible thanks also to Milan's broad background with different research themes and technologies: he learned his trade in [Seamus Davis’ SI-STM lab](http://davisgroup.lassp.cornell.edu/) and with [Felix Baumberger](http://dpmc.unige.ch/gr_baumberger/index.html), and later moved as an [ETH fellow](http://www.ethfellows.ethz.ch/) to [Andreas Wallraff’s qudev lab](http://www.qudev.ethz.ch/) where he investigated coupled cavity arrays in circuit QED. We further have group members with different background and interests, working together on physics and instrumentation.

Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:

**Mechanistic Exploration of Transition Metal Catalyzed Cross-Coupling
Reactions using Quantum Chemical Studies** 

Our work is primarily based on the cross-coupling reactions catalyzed by earth abundant, economical, first-row late transition metals like Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn. Due consideration isgiven to both carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom cross coupling reactions. Using theDensity Functional Theory (DFT) methods, the thermodynamics and kinetics of the key stepsinvolved in the cross-coupling reactions could be explored. Finding out the most feasiblepathway for a particular reaction, could be evoked by probing the nature of transition states, involved in the crucial steps. Due to the inadequacy of experimental techniques in characterizing the transition states, computational techniques emerged as an excellent tool to probe the details of the former. We diligently collaborate with the experimental catalysis research group of Dr. G. Anilkumar ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=slKQckwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)) at School of Chemical sciences, MGU, Kerala. For good measure, we also explore the metal- ligand interactions of the active catalytic species present in the reaction. Insights gained in this way will aid in the designing of efficient catalysts and could be extended further to the design of biologically active compounds like benzofuran derivatives.

**Efficient chromophores for Organic Photovoltaics**
Organic Solar Cells are considered as a promising photovoltaic technology which has the potential to provide moderate power conversion efficiencies with low cost and easy processability.  Organic solar cells utilises organic molecules as chromophores which absorbs light and generates excitons which is then converted into electricity.  An important limitation for solar cell efficiency is associated with spectral loss associated with the band gap of the material i.e; the chromophore will not be able to absorb photon below the energy band gap of the material and consequently this energy is lost. Up conversion process which convert low energy photons into high energy photons can be utilised to harvest those unused sub-threshold photons there by increasing the efficiency of the solar cell. In organic molecules this can be achieved by Triplet-Triplet Annihilation (TTA) in which two low energy triplet exciton are converted into a high energy singlet exciton which can be absorbed by the cell. 

Another limitation associated with efficiency of solar cell is thermalization ie, both the absorption of high and low energy photons generates one electron hole pair and the excess energy associated with high energy  photons is lost as heat. This limitation can be overcome by multi exciton generation process in organic molecules via singlet fission. Singlet fission (SF) involves the conversion of a high energy singlet exciton into two low energy triplet excitons. Singlet fission is actually the opposite process of Triplet-Triplet Annihilation.

Integrating both Singlet fission and Triplet-Triplet Annihilation in a solar cell can significantly increase its efficiency by reducing energy loss associated with both low and high energy end of the solar spectrum. But, the integration of TTA and SF into a solar cell is limited by the fact that a very few chromophores are currently known to exhibit these photophysical processes. Exploration of the vast chemical space by computational methods could accelerate the discovery of materials capable of undergoing TTA and SF. 
We utilise Time Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) and post Hartree- Fock Methods such as Complete Active Space Self Consistent Field Method (CASSCF) and Multi Reference Configuration Interaction Method (MRCI) to describe the excited state properties of computationally designed new chromophores.

 Atmospheric oxidative reactions are ubiquitous on our planet as these reactions orchestrate important effect on several environmental processes ranging from the formation of atmospheric contaminants to acid rain. The earth’s atmosphere especially ionosphere is a region of the upper atmosphere containing many ions. The most complicated chemistry occurs in the D-region and is noticeable for the existence of cluster ions. The composition of D-layers has important consequences for the attenuation of radio signal. Neutral species could be readily ionised by the interaction of the chemiions present in the atmosphere. Once these ions have been formed they can be involved in complicated reactions, and characterizing the mechanisms of these reactions is important for our understanding of the chemical composition of the atmosphere. These charged species could also be obtained from the combustion of fossil fuel in the jet engine exhaust. The combustion of fossil fuels in the jet engines as well as the rocket engine leads to the formation of major organic pollutants. Recent studies found that ozonation of organic pollutants with dimethylamino groups produces N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) that is highly carcinogenic to humans. However, the formation mechanism of NDMA remains inexplicit, and previously proposed mechanisms are inconsistent with experimental observations. These atmospheric chemical phenomenons which involve the formation and removal of trace gases in the environment contribute to the determination of air quality.

Our focus in this area is to investigate the plausible mechanism of formation of the important gas phase nitrogenous compounds in the environment formed via the binary/ternary associative attachments between the nitrogen species with atmospheric trace gases. In particular we have been interested in developing different reaction pathways for the formation of negatively charged oxides of nitrogen, from the interaction of molecular nitrogen and oxides of nitrogen with the negatively charged oxygen ions(On-) and also the formation of neutral nitrosamines by the ozonation of different hydrazine compounds. For example we have recently developed the oxidative reaction pathway for the reaction of N2/NOx with superoxide and ozone anion. The nature of these reactions can be studied with quantum chemical calculations. Quantum chemical calculations have advantages in exploring reaction mechanisms by identifying transient species and providing thermodynamic data. We are also interested in developing the quantum chemical methods to study the structure, spectroscopy and reactivity of different positively and negatively charged hydrated cluster ion species in the atmosphere.
