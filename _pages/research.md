# Research

Our overarching goal is to explore and understand new quantum states of electronic matter on the atomic scale. To do so, we use and develop novel spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM) tools to visualize the relevant quantum mechanical degrees of freedom.

Our goal is to build instruments and develop techniques that enable us to address the questions we find most interesting. This is possible thanks also to Milan's broad background with different research themes and technologies: he learned his trade in [Seamus Davis’ SI-STM lab](http://davisgroup.lassp.cornell.edu/) and with [Felix Baumberger](http://dpmc.unige.ch/gr_baumberger/index.html), and later moved as an [ETH fellow](http://www.ethfellows.ethz.ch/) to [Andreas Wallraff’s qudev lab](http://www.qudev.ethz.ch/) where he investigated coupled cavity arrays in circuit QED. We further have group members with different background and interests, working together on physics and instrumentation.

Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:

**Mechanistic Exploration of Transition Metal Catalyzed Cross-Coupling
Reactions using Quantum Chemical Studies** 

Our work is primarily based on the cross-coupling reactions catalyzed by earth abundant, economical, first-row late transition metals like Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn. Due consideration isgiven to both carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom cross coupling reactions. Using theDensity Functional Theory (DFT) methods, the thermodynamics and kinetics of the key stepsinvolved in the cross-coupling reactions could be explored. Finding out the most feasiblepathway for a particular reaction, could be evoked by probing the nature of transition states, involved in the crucial steps. Due to the inadequacy of experimental techniques in characterizing the transition states, computational techniques emerged as an excellent tool to probe the details of the former. We diligently collaborate with the experimental catalysis research group of Dr. G. Anilkumar ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=slKQckwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)) at School of Chemical sciences, MGU, Kerala. For good measure, we also explore the metal- ligand interactions of the active catalytic species present in the reaction. Insights gained in this way will aid in the designing of efficient catalysts and could be extended further to the design of biologically active compounds like benzofuran derivatives.
