Our research group is directed towards understanding and solving some of the challenging and exciting problems in science by utilizing the power of computational and theoretical methods. Our mission is to shed light on the canopy of unexplored knowledge with the aid of computational methods based on classical and modern theories for understanding experimental observations. 

We seek to explore the origin of a diverse series of scientific phenomena with the aid of the above techniques. By doing so, we are also aiming at making science more interesting and fascinating for the researchers who practice it.

The vital areas of our research cover nanotechnology, catalysis, atmospheric chemistry, optics, materials physics and biophysics (see [Research](research)). We have also partnered with many theoretical and experimental groups, that span academic and industrial institutions (see [Collaborations](Collaborations)). To foster the importance of science in the academic community, we also conduct research for undergraduate science students, by exposing them to the fascinating world of computational modeling techniques.

We are located at the Department of Chemistry, CMS College, Kottayam (*an autonomous college affiliated to Mahatma gandhi University Kottayam*). Founded in **1817**, the [CMS College](https://cmscollege.ac.in/) is now one of the largest colleges in Kerala with 23 departments offering 47 courses for 2521 students, 138 teaching faculty members and 35 administrative staffs.

Within the [Department](https://cmscollege.ac.in/department-of-chemistry.html?dept_id=8), students are always encouraged to work alongside with faculty on research projects and as coauthors on research publications. Students will develop critical and analytical thinking skills as they apply the knowledge and skills from your formal classrooms to cutting-edge research problems. Our graduates are well prepared to enter doctoral degree programs or to directly pursue careers in other fields such as education,  chemical, pharmaceutical industry, business, environmental science, pharmacology, toxicology, geochemistry and others.

 **We are  looking for passionate new PhD students, and Master students to join the team** [(more info)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/vacancies) **!**

The Chemistry Department is a Research Centre of the M.G. University from 1985 vide order no. ACAII/1/504/85 dated 29.10.1985.
