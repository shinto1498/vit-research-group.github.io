# Open positions

**Note: We currently don’t have openings for an additional PhD student. Three PhD positions
will be available from June 2023. Postdoc applications are welcome you if you have a
fellowship. I’d be happy to support you after you apply to our group.**




We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

You will have the chance to work on the grand challenges of Molecular dynamics, quantum mechanics, Plasmonics. You will be involved in determining the important and interesting questions, modelling and optimizing chemical bonds/plasmonic nanostructures, performing simulations, and making discoveries.

### Applications for PhD positions
If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student or postdoc, please send me an [email](vibin@cmscollege.ac.in). State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates. **Important**: please insert _"Application PhD"_ in the subject line. If you are applying to a specific advertisement, note this in your email.


### Master projects for CMS College students

### Bsc / Master students from elsewhere
